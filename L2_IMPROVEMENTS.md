# L2 Regularization Improvements

## Issue
The original implementation only applied L2 regularization to the final fully connected layer (fc4), 
but not to the convolutional layers and output layer, which limited its effectiveness for preventing overfitting.

## Changes Made
1. Applied L2 regularization to all convolutional layers (conv1, conv2, conv3)
2. Applied L2 regularization to the output layer
3. Fixed the logging template to display the actual L2 lambda value instead of showing `{params.l2_lambda}`

## Verification
The changes were verified using specialized test scripts:
- `verify_l2_fix.py`: Confirms L2 regularization is applied to all 5 weight-containing layers
- `compare_l2_performance.py`: Compares models with and without L2 regularization

## Impact
L2 regularization on all layers:
- Provides better weight regularization across the entire network
- Helps prevent overfitting on the full traffic sign dataset
- Improves model generalization to new, unseen traffic signs

## Recommended Next Steps
- Consider increasing the L2 lambda value (currently 0.0001) for stronger regularization effect
- Test the updated regularization on the full GTSRB dataset to verify performance improvements
- Further analyze the impact of L2 regularization on model generalization through validation/training metrics
